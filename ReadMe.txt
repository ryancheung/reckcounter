ReckCounter v1.3a by Warflea of Azjol-Nerub

ReckCounter is an add on for Paladins which tracks stored extra attacks generated by the Reckoning talent.

Generally, Reckoning strikes are saved when auto attack is off and the attacks are released when auto attack is started regardless of whether the strikes are able to hit.

ReckCounter displays near the minimap as 4 "combo point" circles.  As you gain Reckoning strikes, out of combat, the circles will light up from left to right.
